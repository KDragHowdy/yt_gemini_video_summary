## Video Analysis: Michael Popok on Election Tampering and Justice for Donald Trump

This video features Michael Popok, a legal commentator, discussing the conviction of former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters on seven out of ten felony counts related to election tampering in Colorado. The video also touches on the ongoing legal battles against Donald Trump in other parts of the country.

### Key Points and Information Presented:

Michael highlights the speed of the jury's verdict (less than 4 hours) and emphasizes the severity of the charges against Tina, including election tampering, official misconduct, and attempting to influence a public servant. Michael asserts that her actions were motivated by a loyalty to Donald Trump and the "Maga" movement, rather than upholding her sworn duty to the US Constitution and American voters.

"She's got four felonies that'll put her in jail for a long long time," Michael states, emphasizing the seriousness of the conviction. 

The video connects Tina's conviction to the broader trend of individuals being held accountable for attempting to overturn the 2020 election results. Michael refers to the legal cases against Trump, including the 34 felony counts in New York, and suggests that these cases are part of a broader effort to bring justice to those who interfered with the electoral process. 

"He is being brought to Justice in places like New York and the Manhattan da having prosecuted him successfully for 34 felony counts," Michael explains, referring to the legal cases against Trump. 

"He's not going to win. He's going to go to jail and you're going to go to jail just like Tina Peters if you continue to interfere with the will of the people," Michael warns, emphasizing the potential consequences for those who engage in election interference.

Michael also warns election officials who are willing to put their loyalty to Trump and the "Maga" movement above their duty to the country. He suggests that such actions could lead to serious consequences, including jail time.

"Here's a warning to all of those people that are in election offices who are election workers or who are clerks who have decided to pledge their loyalty not to the US Constitution and the American voter but to Donald Trump," Michael warns, addressing election officials directly.  

Michael emphasizes the importance of his podcast "Legal AF" and encourages viewers to become free subscribers. He argues that a larger audience allows him to reach more people with critical information about the legal issues unfolding in the US.
