## The Future of AI: From Benchmarks to Enterprise Adoption

The speaker argues that current AI benchmarks, while impressive, are not truly indicative of real-world intelligence. They highlight the limitations of these benchmarks in evaluating adaptability, long-term horizons, and chaotic environments. The speaker believes that achieving a 95th percentile on these benchmarks is not a significant milestone, as it merely signifies proficiency in taking tests, not true intelligence.

**Key Points:**

* **Benchmarks are not sufficient:** Current AI benchmarks are not comprehensive enough to measure real intelligence, which requires adaptability and navigation of complex, real-world scenarios.
* **Enterprise adoption is slow:** Despite advancements in AI, Enterprise corporations remain skeptical about its readiness for deployment. Small and medium businesses (SMBs) are leading the adoption curve due to their agility and ability to pivot quickly.
* **Job dislocation is on the horizon:** As AI models become more sophisticated and cost-effective, they are likely to displace some jobs in 2025.
* **General purpose models are the future:** The speaker envisions a future where AI models are "general purpose," capable of handling any type of data and task, akin to a "ready-to-go off-the-shelf Droid brain." These models, expected around 2026, could be considered early forms of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

**Notable Quotes:**

* "Real intelligence is about long-time horizons, chaotic environments, and adaptation."
* "It's like okay, it's good at taking a test, but real intelligence is about long-time horizons, chaotic environments, and adaptation, and there's not really testing that right now."
* "2025 is still going to be a relatively tepid year at least at the Enterprise scale."
* "Smaller companies can pivot faster, so we're probably going to see more hiring in the startup space and the SMB space where AI is concerned."
* "By then people might be saying yeah, this basically qualifies as AGI, honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if we call those early AGI."

**Themes:**

* **The limitations of current AI benchmarks.**
* **The future of AI adoption in different sectors.**
* **The potential impact of AI on the job market.**
* **The emergence of general purpose AI models and their implications.**

The speaker concludes by expressing optimism about the future of AI, predicting that by 2026, AI models will be considered "Enterprise ready" and capable of handling a wide range of tasks. These models, with their potential for general purpose applications, could mark the beginning of a new era in AI, potentially leading to the development of early forms of AGI.
