   I Am an Accelerationist

   I am embracing the identity of an accelerationist, believing it is morally imperative to advance technological and scientific progress, particularly in AI. My perspective is that this approach is the optimal strategy from a game theory standpoint. I have yet to encounter credible models or frameworks that convincingly justify fears of existential or suffering risks posed by AI advancements. Despite being uncertain for some time, I’ve observed that the AI safety movement is undermined by purity testing and virtue signaling, suggesting a lack of substantial grounding. The fear that “AI will kill everyone” remains an unfounded and baseless prediction. 

   Moral Good: Embracing technology and science progress as a moral good. 

   Game Theory Optimal: Ideal strategies favor acceleration in technology and AI.

   X-Risk Minimal: Skeptical of models predicting existential or suffering risks.

   Safety Movement: Concerned about internal purity testing and virtue signaling.

   Unfounded Predictions: “AI will kill everyone” lacks evidence and basis.

   Acceleration as Moral Good

   Accelerating technological and scientific progress is crucial because any delay prolongs unnecessary suffering. By rapidly advancing solutions to critical issues like climate change, health, aging, and AI-augmented representation, we can alleviate global challenges such as poverty, hunger, and disease more swiftly. AI, in particular, holds the potential to unify and equalize societies on a global scale, prompting humanity to reflect on its collective identity and fostering a sense of oneness. Embracing acceleration can catalyze transformative change, leading to a more equitable and sustainable future for all. 

   Alleviating Suffering: Faster solutions reduce global poverty, hunger, and disease.

   Critical Issues: Focus on climate change, health, aging, and AI representation.

   Global Unity: AI fosters unity and equality on the international stage.

   Collective Reflection: Encourages humanity to view itself as one species. 

   Transformative Change: Accelerating progress leads to equity and sustainability.

   Game Theory Optimal Strategy

   In the landscape of technological progress, slowing down is not incentivized, making it futile to advocate for deceleration. The momentum is undeniable, and it is more strategic to navigate the current rather than resist it. To promote positive outcomes, we must accelerate faster than potential negative forces. Corporations, nations, and universities all have aligned incentives to create AI and advance technology. Instead of wishing for an alternative path, resources should be committed to optimizing our direction concerning current attractor states. Acceleration is inevitable, so embrace it and become adept at navigating the rapid developments.

   No Incentives: Slowing down lacks incentives and is counterproductive.

   Navigate the Current: Focus on expert navigation rather than resistance.

   Positive Outcomes: Accelerate faster than negative forces.

   Aligned Incentives: Corporations, nations, and universities support advancement.

   Optimize Direction: Commit resources to ensure an optimal path forward.

   Prophetic AI Risks

   My main critique of the AI safety movement is its reliance on abstract philosophical speculation with minimal empirical evidence or ontological basis. Catastrophic AI risks are predominantly hypothetical and asserted without substantial data. Consequently, the notion that “AI will kill everyone” seems more like a prophecy than a grounded prediction. This worldview necessitates numerous assumptions about machine intelligence and its future trajectory. Such assumptions, rather than empirical observations, pose a potential greater danger in addressing real-world challenges.

   Philosophical Speculation: AI safety relies on abstract conjecture.

   Lack of Evidence: Risks are based on hypotheticals, not data. 

   Prophetic Nature: “AI will kill everyone” is a prophetic assertion.

   Assumptions Required: Worldview relies on multiple unverified assumptions.

   Real-World Danger: Assumptions pose more risk than observed phenomena.
