### 3. Notable Quotes

* "If you look at what is your ethical framework or what is your philosophical framework... reduce suffering in the universe, increase prosperity in the universe, and increase understanding in the universe... the best way to do that is with AI." (Reference: Slide 2, "Acceleration as Moral Good") 
* "There are no incentives to slow down. The only incentive is an imaginary incentive, which is that if we don't slow down, we're going to kill everyone." (Reference: Slide 3, "Game Theory Optimal Strategy")
* "I have not seen any credible evidence that AI is difficult to align... Literally every time we have a complaint about how difficult it is to align AI, within 6 to 12 months, people have published dozens, if not hundreds, of papers on how to overcome that." (Reference: Slide 1, "I Am an Accelerationist")
* "The safety movement itself is becoming problematic... Any time a movement is running out of steam, it kind of devolves into purity testing and virtue signaling and starts to cannibalize itself... They have no data, they have no evidence, they don't have a solid theory." (Reference: Slide 1, "I Am an Accelerationist")
* "We can Portage around the waterfall, but if all you're saying is just get out of the river for good, then that's not helpful at all." (Reference: Slide 3, "Game Theory Optimal Strategy")
* "A prophecy is an assertion about what will happen in the future without evidence, data, or any models... it basically comes down to 'well, I used my imagination and pure logic, so trust me bro.'" (Reference: Slide 4, "Prophectic AI Risks")
* "AI is holding a Black Mirror up to us, and we are afraid of ourselves, we are ashamed of ourselves, and we are treating AI like a scapegoat." (Reference: Slide 5, "Acceleration as Moral Good")
* "We need to actually learn to navigate with this energy, and actually use it, and accelerate towards those positive outcomes." (Reference: Slide 3, "Game Theory Optimal Strategy") 

### 4. Intertextual References

* **Objective Function:** This reference (Slide 2, "Acceleration as Moral Good") is used to frame the speaker's argument for accelerationism as a rational and objective approach. It suggests that accelerating technological progress is aligned with maximizing ethical values, contrasting it with the more emotional and subjective fears expressed by some proponents of AI safety.
