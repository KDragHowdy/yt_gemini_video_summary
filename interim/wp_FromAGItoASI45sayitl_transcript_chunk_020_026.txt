* **The "Doomer" Label:** The speaker discusses the use of the term "Doomer" in the AI community and its potential for mischaracterization.

### 2. Key Arguments and Points

* **The Speaker's AI Risk Assessment:** The speaker expresses relatively low confidence in ASI being hostile, believing that hostility is decreasing as they learn more. They also argue that the likelihood of ASI pursuing its own goals is likely overestimated, as AI developers will likely find ways to control advanced AI systems.
* **Public Misunderstanding of AI:** The speaker criticizes public polls on AI trust, arguing that they often focus on outdated or irrelevant examples of AI, such as facial recognition. The speaker believes that the public is largely unaware of the potential risks of advanced AI systems.
* **The Infeasibility of Pausing AI Development:** The speaker highlights the poll results showing that while a significant portion of their audience would support a pause in AI development, a much smaller percentage believe it is feasible. This suggests a disconnect between desire and practical possibility.
* **The Misuse of the "Doomer" Label:** The speaker argues that the term "Doomer" is often used inappropriately in the AI community, potentially mischaracterizing individuals who are simply expressing concerns about AI risks.
