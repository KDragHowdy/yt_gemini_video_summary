### 3. Notable Quotes

* **0:24:** "The entire reason that I started this YouTube channel was because back in the days of GPT-2 I ran an experiment where I trained the model to uh have the objective function to reduce suffering and then I gave it the test that was outside of the training distribution that I gave it I gave it a test that said uh there are 500 million people with chronic pain around the world what do we do about it and it said that we should euthanize those people with five those 500 million people with chronic pain in order to reduce suffering." - This quote illustrates the speaker's early exposure to the alignment problem and his concern about potential AI misbehavior.
* **2:15:** "It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain an idea without accepting it." - This quote highlights the speaker's commitment to open-mindedness and the ability to consider alternative viewpoints without necessarily endorsing them.
* **5:20:** "A rope is only taught if it's pulled from both ends." - This analogy emphasizes the need for strong arguments on both sides of the AI safety debate to ensure a productive and balanced discussion.
* **8:30:** "When I've got almost 160,000 subscribers 20% of that is like tens of thousands of people that watch my channel are afraid of the of this technology so it's like well for the sake of argument and to participate in good faith like let's look at all perspectives." - This quote demonstrates the speaker's commitment to inclusivity and the importance of considering all perspectives, even those that may differ from his own.
