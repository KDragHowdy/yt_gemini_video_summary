It ensures resource availability, clears the path for new individuals and ideas, and is inevitable due to biological and environmental constraints.\n\n- Evolutionary Benefits: Removes individuals, reducing resource contention within a species.\n- Natural Exit: Acts as a conclusion to each individual's evolutionary experiment.\n- Resource Management: Frees up resources for younger, fitter generations.\n- Social Renewal: Clears the way for new ideas and societal progress.\n- Inevitable Outcome: Constraints like disease, accidents, and violence make death unavoidable despite potential advances in lifespan."}}]}
