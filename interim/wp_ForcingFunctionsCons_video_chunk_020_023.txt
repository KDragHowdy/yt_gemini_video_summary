    - **Title:** Death as a Forcing Function
    - **Text:** Death acts as a critical forcing function from both evolutionary and social perspectives. It ensures resource availability, clears the path for new individuals and ideas, and is inevitable due to biological and environmental constraints.
    - **Bullet Points:**
        - **Evolutionary Benefits:** Removes individuals, reducing resource contention within a species.
        - **Natural Exit:** Acts as a conclusion to each individual's evolutionary experiment.
        - **Resource Management:** Frees up resources for younger, fitter generations.
        - **Social Renewal:** Clears the way for new ideas and societal progress.
        - **Inevitabl Outcome:** Constraints like disease, accidents, and violence make death unavoidable despite potential advances in lifespan.
