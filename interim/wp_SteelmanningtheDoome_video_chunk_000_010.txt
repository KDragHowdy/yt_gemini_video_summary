In this presentation, I often operate within an analytical thirdspace, where I temporarily accept premises I don't truly endorse—commonly known as 'steelmanning' an argument. This approach can create an impression of inconsistency, as I frequently forget to clarify that I'm merely testing ideas. I view this as trying ideas on for size, a practice that aligns with the notion that an educated mind can entertain thoughts without necessarily accepting them. Additionally, Kegan's stages of development emphasize the importance of being aware of one's own point of view, inhabiting others' perspectives, and understanding systems within systems. This slide aims to explain any perceived inconsistency in my approach. Analytical Thirdspace: Temporarily accepting premises I don't endorse. Steelmanning: Strengthening opposing arguments to test their validity. Idea Testing: Trying on ideas without committing to them. Kegan's Development Stages: Emphasizing perspective awareness and systems thinking. Clarifying Consistency: Explaining apparent inconsistencies in my approach."

While there are counter-examples, such as jailbreaking models, adversarial attacks, and other vulnerabilities, these issues do not indicate fundamental failure modes. Instead, they represent challenges that can be addressed through improved safety measures, rather than proof of inherent dangers in AI systems. No Intrinsic Incorrigibility: AI models have not shown themselves to be unsteerable. No Latent Malevolence: There's no evidence AI systems are inherently malevolent. Counter-Examples: Vulnerabilities like jailbreaking and adversarial attacks exist. Not Fundamental: These vulnerabilities are not indicative of deeper or permanent failure modes. Improvement Potential: Safety measures can mitigate current AI challenges."
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide presents the current arguments against the idea that AI is inherently dangerous. The presenter argues that there is no evidence to support the claim that AI is either unsteerable or inherently malevolent. He acknowledges the existence of vulnerabilities, but he argues that these are not fundamental flaws in AI systems.

The presenter is in the foreground, looking at the image and speaking into a microphone. The text on the slide reads: "20% Doomers. Around 20% of my audience aligns with the belief that AI will lead to catastrophic outcomes. I've identified this through split-half consistency testing, where I ask different questions aimed at uncovering the same underlying belief. For example, I might ask how many would support pausing AI development and then inquire how many think AI will ultimately cause human extinction. These questions consistently converge on roughly the same subset of respondents, providing a reliable measure of this belief within my audience. AI Doom Belief: 20% of my audience expects catastrophic AI outcomes. Split-Half Testing: Method used to validate this belief across different questions. Triangulation: Different questions target similar underlying beliefs. Consistent Convergence: Results consistently point to the same audience segment. Audience Insight: Understanding this helps tailor the rest of the presentation."
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide presents the presenter's findings from a survey he conducted on his audience's beliefs about AI. He found that approximately 20% of his audience believes that AI will lead to catastrophic outcomes. This finding is important because it helps the presenter to understand the concerns of his audience and to tailor his presentation accordingly.

The creation of bioweapons is, in my view, the most significant risk posed by AI. As AI systems advance in material science, exemplified by projects like AlphaFold, the ability to design chemical and biological agents—such as prions or viruses—becomes dangerously accessible. Many of these breakthroughs are being released open source and fall under DURC (Dual Use Research of Concern). The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated how biological agents can evolve uncontrollably, and require no energy or oversight to spread. For those bent on causing mass extinction, an engineered plague could be the "best" method, or at least a precursor to human extermination. AI dramatically lowers the threshold of danger, making these capabilities more accessible to state actors or terrorists. Bioweapon Risk: AI advancements make designing deadly agents easier. Material Science: Projects like AlphaFold increase capabilities in bioengineering. DURC Concerns: Dual-use research heightens the risk of misuse. Pandemic Lessons: Biological agents can evolve uncontrollably and spread autonomously. Lowered Threshold: AI reduces the barriers for state actors or terrorists to create bioweapons."
