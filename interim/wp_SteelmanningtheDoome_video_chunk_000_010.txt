Below the title, there's a paragraph of text explaining the lack of empirical evidence for AI's inherent incorrigibility or malevolence. The text also mentions counter-examples like jailbreaking models and adversarial attacks, but argues that these are not indicative of fundamental failure modes. The text concludes by emphasizing the potential for improvement in AI safety measures.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide presents the current arguments against the idea that AI is inherently dangerous or uncontrollable. The presenter argues that the existing evidence doesn't support these claims and that AI's vulnerabilities can be addressed through ongoing research and development.
- **Emphasis:** The presenter highlights the five bullet points by using a slightly larger font size and spacing them out clearly. Each bullet point is a counter-argument to the idea that AI is inherently dangerous:
    - No Intrinsic Incorrigibility: AI models have not shown themselves to be unsteerable.
    - No Latent Malevolence: There's no evidence AI systems are inherently malevolent.
    - Counter-Examples: Vulnerabilities like jailbreaking and adversarial attacks exist.
    - Not Fundamental: These vulnerabilities are not indicative of deeper or permanent failure modes.
    - Improvement Potential: Safety measures can mitigate current AI challenges.
- **Imagery:** The slide features two large, stylized images of microphones on stands, positioned on either side of the presenter. These microphones represent the act of communication and the exchange of ideas.

## Slide 4: 20% Doomers
- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 4:28 - 5:47
- **Description:** The slide features the title "20% Doomers" in large, bold white text against a black background. Below the title, there's a paragraph of text explaining that roughly 20% of the presenter's audience aligns with the belief that AI will lead to catastrophic outcomes. The presenter describes using split-half consistency testing and triangulation to validate this belief.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide reveals the results of the presenter's audience research, indicating that a significant portion of his audience holds a doomerist view of AI. The presenter uses this information to tailor his presentation and address these concerns directly.
- **Emphasis:** The presenter emphasizes the percentage "20%" by using a slightly larger font size and placing it prominently at the top of the slide.
- **Imagery:** The slide features a large image of the Terminator, a popular fictional representation of an advanced AI that poses a threat to humanity. The Terminator's metallic, imposing presence reinforces the doomerist perspective.
- **Visual Theme:** The use of bold white text against a black background continues to create a sense of seriousness and authority. The Terminator image adds a dramatic visual element, highlighting the potential dangers of AI.

## Slide 5: How AI Could Spell Disaster
- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 5:47 - 7:40
- **Description:** The slide features the title "How AI Could Spell Disaster" in large, bold white text against a black background. Below the title, there's a paragraph of text explaining that while the likelihood of AI leading to disaster is low, it remains a genuine possibility worth exploring. The presenter estimates his probability of AI-driven doom at around 30%, primarily due to the absence of key safeguards, such as an international research organization. The text also mentions the risk of widespread suffering caused by AI misuse.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide presents the presenter's own perspective on the likelihood of AI-driven disaster. While acknowledging the low probability, he emphasizes the importance of exploring the potential risks and taking steps to mitigate them.
- **Emphasis:** The presenter highlights the five bullet points by using a slightly larger font size and spacing them out clearly. Each bullet point outlines a key concern regarding AI's potential for disaster:
    - Low Likelihood: Personally assess AI-driven disaster as unlikely (~30%).
    - Key Milestones: The lack of an international research body heightens risk.
    - Risk of Suffering: Corporate greed and power structures are major concerns.
