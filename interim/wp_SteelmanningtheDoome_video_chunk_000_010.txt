    - No Intrinsic Incorrigibility: AI models have not shown themselves to be unsteerable.
    - No Latent Malevolence: There's no evidence AI systems are inherently malevolent.
    - Counter-Examples: Vulnerabilities like jailbreaking and adversarial attacks exist.
    - Not Fundamental: These vulnerabilities are not indicative of deeper or permanent failure modes.
    - Improvement Potential: Safety measures can mitigate current AI challenges.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide presents the current arguments against AI, which are primarily based on the lack of empirical evidence for AI's inherent incorrigibility or malevolence. The presenter uses these arguments as a starting point for his own analysis.
- **Emphasis:** The presenter emphasizes the lack of evidence for AI's inherent incorrigibility or malevolence, suggesting that these concerns are not necessarily justified.

## Slide 4: 20% Doomers
- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 4:28 - 5:46
- **Description:** This slide features a title "20% Doomers" and a paragraph of text explaining the presenter's findings about the prevalence of doomer beliefs in his audience.

The presenter is standing in front of a microphone and a camera, wearing a red Star Trek uniform. He is looking directly at the camera with a serious expression.  Below the paragraph, there are five bullet points:
    - AI Doom Belief: 20% of my audience expects catastrophic AI outcomes.
    - Split-Half Testing: Method used to validate this belief across different questions.
    - Triangulation: Different questions target similar underlying beliefs.
    - Consistent Convergence: Results consistently point to the same audience segment.
    - Audience Insight: Understanding this helps tailor the rest of the presentation.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide presents the presenter's findings about the prevalence of doomer beliefs in his audience. He uses this information to tailor the rest of his presentation.
- **Emphasis:** The presenter emphasizes the 20% figure, suggesting that a significant portion of his audience holds doomer beliefs.

## Slide 5: How AI Could Spell Disaster
- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 5:47 - 7:38

The presenter is standing in front of a microphone and a camera, wearing a red Star Trek uniform. He is looking directly at the camera with a serious expression.  Below the paragraph, there are five bullet points:
    - Low Likelihood: I personally assess AI-driven disaster as unlikely (~30%).
    - Key Milestones: The lack of an international research body heightens risk.
    - Risk of Suffering: Corporate greed and power structures are major concerns.
    - Steelman Approach: Exploring the strongest arguments for AI-driven doom.
    - Genuine Possibility: Taking an honest look at how AI could go wrong.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide presents the presenter's own assessment of the likelihood of AI leading to disaster. He believes that the likelihood is low, but that it remains a genuine possibility worth exploring.
