### Slide 2: Analytical Thirdspace (1:20-2:36)

- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 1:20-2:36
- **Description:** The slide features the title "Analytical Thirdspace" in large, white font. Below the title, there is a block of text explaining the concept of analytical thirdspace, which involves temporarily accepting premises one doesn't truly endorse to strengthen opposing arguments. The slide also lists four key aspects of this approach: Analytical Thirdspace, Steelmanning, Idea Testing, Kegan's Development Stages, and Clarifying Consistency. The background features a large image of a classical painting depicting a man's face. The presenter appears in the lower right corner, looking directly at the camera and explaining the concept of analytical thirdspace.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide explains the methodology the presenter will use throughout the video.
- **Emphasis:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of "Steelmanning" and "Clarifying Consistency," highlighting the need to rigorously test opposing arguments and address potential inconsistencies.

### Slide 3: Current Arguments (2:37-4:27)

- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 2:37-4:27
- **Description:** The slide features the title "Current Arguments" in large, white font. Below the title, there is a block of text outlining the current arguments against the idea of AI being inherently incorrigible or malevolent. The text highlights four main points: No Intrinsic Incorrigibility, No Latent Malevolence, Counter-Examples, and Not Fundamental. The background features two large, wooden podiums with microphones. The presenter appears in the lower right corner, looking directly at the camera and explaining the current arguments against AI doomerism.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide presents the arguments that AI is not inherently dangerous, which the presenter will then challenge with "steelmanning" later in the video.
- **Emphasis:** The presenter emphasizes the lack of empirical evidence for AI being inherently malevolent, highlighting the need for further research and analysis.

### Slide 4: 20% Doomers (4:28-5:46)

- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 4:28-5:46
- **Description:** The slide features the title "20% Doomers" in large, white font. Below the title, there is a block of text explaining that the presenter has identified a segment of his audience (roughly 20%) who believes that AI will lead to catastrophic outcomes. The text also outlines the methods used to identify this belief: Split-Half Testing, Triangulation, Consistent Convergence, and Audience Insight. The background features a large image of the Terminator, a popular fictional representation of a dangerous AI. The presenter appears in the lower right corner, looking directly at the camera and explaining the methodology used to identify the "doomer" segment of his audience.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide introduces the "doomer" belief, which the presenter will then address with a more nuanced perspective.
- **Emphasis:** The presenter emphasizes the "Audience Insight" gained from identifying this segment, suggesting that understanding this belief is crucial for tailoring future presentations.

### Slide 5: How AI Could Spell Disaster (5:47-7:38)

- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 5:47-7:38
- **Description:** The slide features the title "How AI Could Spell Disaster" in large, white font. Below the title, there is a block of text explaining that while the likelihood of AI leading to disaster is low, it remains a genuine possibility worth exploring. The text also outlines the presenter's personal probability of AI-driven doom (around 30%) and highlights the key milestones, risk of suffering, and steelman approach that will be discussed in the video. The background features a large image of a robotic figure, a visual representation of AI. The presenter appears in the lower right corner, looking directly at the camera and explaining the potential risks of AI.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide sets the stage for the discussion of potential AI risks, acknowledging the "doomer" belief but also presenting a more nuanced perspective.
- **Emphasis:** The presenter emphasizes the "Genuine Possibility" of AI-driven disaster, highlighting the importance of taking a serious look at potential risks.

### Slide 6: Bioweapons (7:39-9:59)

- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 7:39-9:59
- **Description:** The slide features the title "Bioweapons" in large, white font. Below the title, there is a block of text explaining the presenter's view on bioweapons as the most significant risk posed by AI. The text outlines several key points: Bioweapon Risk, Material Science, DURC Concerns, Pandemic Lessons, and Lowered Threshold. The background features a large, stylized image of the letter "A" in a green color scheme. The presenter appears in the lower right corner, looking directly at the camera and explaining the potential risks of bioweapons.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide presents a specific example of a potential AI risk, focusing on the creation of bioweapons.
- **Emphasis:** The presenter emphasizes the "Lowered Threshold" for creating bioweapons due to AI advancements, highlighting the increased accessibility of these technologies to state actors and terrorists.
