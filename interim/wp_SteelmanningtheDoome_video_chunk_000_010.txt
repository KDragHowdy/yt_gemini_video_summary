## Slide 3: Current Arguments

- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 2:37 - 4:27
- **Description:** The slide features the title "Current Arguments" in large, white text. Below it, a paragraph of text explains the current arguments against the claim that AI models are intrinsically incorrigible or latently malevolent. The presenter argues that while there are counter-examples, such as jailbreaking models, adversarial attacks, and other vulnerabilities, these issues do not indicate fundamental failure modes. Instead, they represent challenges that can be addressed through improved safety measures, rather than proof of inherent dangers in AI systems. The slide also includes a bullet point list of key arguments, including "No intrinsic incorrigibility," "No latent malevolence," "Counter-examples," "Not fundamental," and "Improvement potential." The background of the slide is a dark gray with two large, stylized images of microphones, resembling podiums or lecterns. The presenter is visible in the bottom right corner, looking directly at the camera and gesturing with his hands. He is wearing a red Star Trek uniform and has a microphone in front of him.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide presents the current arguments against the doomer perspective on AI. The presenter uses this slide to establish a baseline for his own arguments and to demonstrate that the doomer perspective is not supported by current evidence.
- **Emphasis:** The presenter emphasizes the point that AI vulnerabilities are not indicative of fundamental flaws but rather represent challenges that can be addressed through improved safety measures.

## Slide 4: 20% Doomers

- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 4:28 - 5:46
- **Description:** The slide features the title "20% Doomers" in large, white text. Below it, a paragraph of text explains that roughly 20% of the presenter's audience aligns with the belief that AI will lead to catastrophic outcomes. The presenter uses split-half consistency testing to validate this belief, where he asks different questions aimed at uncovering the same underlying belief. For example, he might ask how many would support pausing AI development and then inquire how many think AI will ultimately cause human extinction. The presenter emphasizes that these questions consistently converge on roughly the same subset of respondents, providing a reliable measure of this belief within his audience. The slide also includes a bullet point list of key terms and concepts related to this analysis, including "AI Doom Belief," "Split-half testing," "Triangulation," "Consistent convergence," and "Audience insight." The background of the slide is a dark gray with a large, stylized image of the T-800 Terminator from the Terminator franchise. The presenter is visible in the bottom right corner, looking directly at the camera and gesturing with his hands. He is wearing a red Star Trek uniform and has a microphone in front of him.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide presents the presenter's own research on the prevalence of the doomer perspective on AI. He uses this data to demonstrate that while the doomer perspective is significant, it is not the majority view.
- **Emphasis:** The presenter emphasizes the use of split-half consistency testing and triangulation to ensure the reliability of his research findings.

## Slide 5: How AI Could Spell Disaster

- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 5:47 - 7:38
- **Description:** The slide features the title "How AI Could Spell Disaster" in large, white text. Below it, a paragraph of text explains that while the presenter believes the likelihood of AI leading to disaster is low, it remains a genuine possibility worth exploring. He estimates the probability of AI-driven doom at around 30%, primarily due to the absence of safeguards, such as an international research organization. The presenter also highlights the risk of widespread suffering, which could be caused by AI's power structures that could misuse AI. The slide also includes a bullet point list of key concerns, including "Low likelihood," "Key milestones," "Risk of suffering," "Steelman approach," and "Genuine possibility." The background of the slide is a dark gray with a large, stylized image of the T-800 Terminator from the Terminator franchise. The presenter is visible in the bottom right corner, looking directly at the camera and gesturing with his hands. He is wearing a red Star Trek uniform and has a microphone in front of him.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide presents the presenter's own perspective on the potential risks of AI. He acknowledges that the doomer perspective is not entirely unfounded but argues that the likelihood of AI-driven disaster is relatively low.
- **Emphasis:** The presenter emphasizes the importance of exploring the possibility of AI-driven disaster, even if it's unlikely. He also highlights the lack of an international research body as a key milestone that could heighten the risk of AI-driven disaster.

## Slide 6: Bioweapons

- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 7:39 - 9:59
- **Description:** The slide features the title "Bioweapons" in large, white text. Below it, a paragraph of text explains that the creation of bioweapons is, in the presenter's view, the most significant risk posed by AI. He argues that AI systems are advancing in material science, exemplified by projects like AlphaFold, which increases the ability to design chemical and biological agents. The presenter also highlights the potential for misuse of these breakthroughs, citing the COVID-19 pandemic and the DURC (Dual Use Research of Concern). He emphasizes that AI can make it easier to design deadly agents and that biological agents can evolve uncontrollably, requiring an oversight to spread. The slide also includes a bullet point list of key concerns, including "Bioweapon risk," "Material science," "DURC concerns," "Pandemic lessons," and "Lowered threshold." The background of the slide is a dark green with a large, stylized image of the letter "A," resembling a warning symbol. The presenter is visible in the bottom right corner, looking directly at the camera and gesturing with his hands. He is wearing a red Star Trek uniform and has a microphone in front of him.
