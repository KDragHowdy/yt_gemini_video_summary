## Slide 2: Analytical Thirdspace
- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 1:20 - 2:36
- **Description:** 
    - Title: "Analytical Thirdspace"
    - Text: "In this presentation, I often operate within an analytical thirdspace, where I temporarily accept premises I don't truly endorse—commonly known as 'steelmanning' an argument. This approach can create an impression of inconsistency, as I frequently forget to clarify that I'm merely testing ideas. I view this as trying ideas on for size, a practice that aligns with the notion that an educated mind can entertain thoughts without necessarily accepting them. Additionally, Kegan's stages of development emphasize the importance of being aware of one's own point of view, inhabiting others' perspectives, and understanding systems within systems. This slide aims to explain any perceived inconsistency in my approach."
    - Imagery: A large, stylized image of a face, resembling a classical portrait, but with an abstract, modern twist. The face is predominantly in shades of brown, with a muted yellow for the hair. The presenter is positioned on the right side of the screen, looking directly at the camera, but slightly down at the text. He is wearing a red Star Trek uniform and has a microphone in front of him.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide explains the methodology the presenter uses in the video, which is to "steelman" the arguments against AI, meaning to present them in their strongest possible form. He acknowledges that this approach can lead to an impression of inconsistency, but he justifies it as a way to test ideas and to encourage a more nuanced understanding of the topic.
- **Emphasis:** The presenter emphasizes the term "analytical thirdspace" by speaking it with a clear and deliberate tone. He also highlights the importance of Kegan's stages of development by mentioning them specifically.

## Slide 3: Current Arguments
- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 2:37 - 4:27
- **Description:** 
    - Title: "Current Arguments"
    - Text: "To date, there is a significant lack of empirical evidence that AI models are intrinsically incorrigible (unsteerable) or latently malevolent. While there are counter-examples, such as jailbreaking models, adversarial attacks, and other vulnerabilities, these issues do not indicate fundamental failure modes. Instead, they represent challenges that can be addressed through improved safety measures, rather than proof of inherent dangers in AI systems."
    - Imagery: Two large, stylized podiums or lecterns in front of a dark, velvety background. The podiums are in shades of grey and have a sleek, modern design. The presenter is positioned on the right side of the screen, looking directly at the camera, but slightly down at the text. He is wearing a red Star Trek uniform and has a microphone in front of him.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide presents the main argument against the doomer perspective on AI. The presenter argues that there is no evidence that AI is inherently incorrigible or malevolent, and that the current vulnerabilities are not fundamental flaws but rather challenges that can be addressed.
- **Emphasis:** The presenter emphasizes the phrase "lack of empirical evidence" by speaking it with a strong and clear tone. He also highlights the term "counter-examples" by using a slightly different tone and a pause for emphasis.

## Slide 4: 20% Doomers
- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 4:28 - 5:46
- **Description:** 
    - Title: "20% Doomers"
    - Text: "Around 20% of my audience aligns with the belief that AI will lead to catastrophic outcomes. I've identified this through split-half consistency testing, where I ask different questions aimed at uncovering the same underlying belief. For example, I might ask how many would support pausing AI development and then inquire how many think AI will ultimately cause human extinction. These questions consistently converge on roughly the same subset of respondents, providing a reliable measure of this belief within my audience."
    - Imagery: A large, stylized image of the Terminator, a metallic, humanoid robot with a red eye. The image is positioned on the right side of the screen, partially obscured by the presenter. The presenter is positioned on the left side of the screen, looking directly at the camera. He is wearing a red Star Trek uniform and has a microphone in front of him.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide presents the results of the presenter's audience research, which indicates that approximately 20% of his audience believes that AI will lead to catastrophic outcomes. The presenter explains the methodology he used to identify this belief, which involves split-half consistency testing and triangulation.
- **Emphasis:** The presenter emphasizes the statistic "20%" by speaking it with a clear and confident tone. He also highlights the term "consistent convergence" by using a slightly different tone and a pause for emphasis.

## Slide 5: How AI Could Spell Disaster
- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 5:47 - 7:40
- **Description:** 
    - Title: "How AI Could Spell Disaster"
    - Text: "Although I believe the likelihood of AI leading to disaster is low, it remains a genuine possibility worth exploring. My probability of AI-driven doom is around 30%, primarily due to the absence of safeguards, such as an international research organization. Additionally, the risk of widespread suffering is significant—not because AI will intentionally cause harm, but due to corporate greed and entrenched power structures that could misuse AI. In this section, we'll steelman the concerns of AI doomsayers, taking a serious look at potential scenarios where AI could spell disaster for humanity as AI-driven disaster."
    - Imagery: A large, stylized image of a robot, similar to the Terminator, but with a more abstract and futuristic design. The image is positioned on the right side of the screen. The presenter is positioned on the left side of the screen, looking directly at the camera. He is wearing a red Star Trek uniform and has a microphone in front of him.

## Slide 6: Bioweapons
- **Type:** Slide
- **Timestamp:** 7:41 - 9:59
- **Description:** 
    - Title: "Bioweapons"
    - Text: "The creation of bioweapons is, in my view, the most significant risk posed by AI. As AI systems advance in material science, exemplified by projects like AlphaFold, the ability to design chemical and biological agents—such as prions or viruses—becomes dangerously accessible. Many of these breakthroughs are being released open source and fall under DURC (Dual Use Research of Concern). The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated how biological agents can evolve uncontrollably, and require no energy or oversight to spread. For those intent on causing mass extinction, an engineered plague could be the 'best' method, or at least a precursor to human extermination. AI dramatically lowers the threshold of danger, making these capabilities more accessible to state actors or terrorists."
    - Imagery: A large, stylized image of a biohazard symbol, a stylized "W" in a green, biohazard-like pattern. The image is positioned on the right side of the screen. The presenter is positioned on the left side of the screen, looking directly at the camera. He is wearing a red Star Trek uniform and has a microphone in front of him.
- **Relation to overall content:** This slide focuses on the presenter's main concern regarding AI, which is the potential for the development of bioweapons. He argues that AI advancements in material science could make it easier for state actors or terrorists to create and deploy deadly biological agents.
