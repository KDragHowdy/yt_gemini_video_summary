These models are expected to be considered \"enterprise-ready\" and \"true general-purpose models.\" Reigniting discussions about AGI, these advanced models will be deployed in smart-home devices and humanoid robots, with capabilities crossing the uncanny valley. We may see domestic robots becoming more accessible, assisting with chores like cooking and cleaning. Additionally, corporations will likely face a significant talent shortage in AI at all levels.\n\nGPT-6 and Claude 5: Anticipated next-generation models considered enterprise ready.\nAGI Discussions: Renewed interest in artificial general intelligence.\nSmart-Home Integration: Advanced AI models in smart-home devices and robots.\nHumanoid Robots: Improved real-time abilities, working alongside humans.\nTalent Shortage: Increased demand for AI professionals across all levels."}, {"type": "slide", "timestamp": "00:30", "content": "2025: Benchmark Mastery\nIn 2025, the focus will likely shift to utilizing and integrating GPT-5 and Claude-4 models. These models are expected to bring incremental improvements, achieving better performance but not revolutionary changes. Achieving around 95% on benchmarks, these models will still significantly impact many fields. Enterprises and SMBs will begin widespread deployment of these AI technologies, leading to increased hiring for AI-enabled roles. However, full integration may face initial infrastructure challenges and require new solutions.\n\nGPT-6 and Claude 4: Incremental improvements over current models.\nBenchmark Performance: Models achieving around 95% on reasoning tasks.\nEnterprise Deployment: Widespread adoption by businesses and SMBs.\nAI Hiring Surge: Increased demand for AI-enabled teams and roles.\nIntegration Challenges: Initial infrastructure limitations and new integration needs."}, {"type": "slide", "timestamp": "03:29", "content": "2027: The Year of AGI\nExperts predict that 2027 may be the year we achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI). Confidence intervals vary, but those with insider knowledge expect the current paradigm to reach AGI around this time.\nCorporations and governments will be highly attentive, leading to a significant market impact and widespread attention. Major disruptions are expected in creative industries, with AI likely producing blockbuster films. Despite AGI's emergence, immediate changes will be tempered by regulations and safety concerns. Investors will push for rapid AI integration, prompting CEOs to accelerate AI product development.\n\nAGI Achievement: Predicted milestone for artificial general intelligence.\nBroad Impact: Significant attention from corporations and governments.\nCreative Disruption: AI's impact on book publishing and Hollywood films.\nRegulatory Constraints: Safety and regulations temper immediate changes.\nInvestor Pressure: Rapid AI integration driven by market demands."}, {"type": "slide", "timestamp": "06:19", "content": "2028: Election Year\nIn 2028, the world will fully recognize the transformative potential of AGI and robots. While initial capabilities may be moderate, their implications will be profound, reshaping business, the economy, military, and politics. The 2028 election will likely center on AI, debating job protection, AI safety, and possibly universal basic income.  Mass layoffs may begin as AGI becomes widespread, driven by market pressures. This period could be marked by geopolitical tensions, with a potential flashpoint being a conflict between China and the USA, where AI might act as a catalyst. \nTransformative AGI: Recognized impact on all sectors.\nPolitical Focus: AI as a central topic in the 2028 election.\nJob Market Shift: Mass layoffs as AGI becomes integrated.\nGeopolitical Tension: Potential conflict between China and the USA.\nSocietal Transition: Struggles and debates around new paradigms."}]}
