## Slide: 2026: Enterprise Ready
By 2026, we will likely be emerging from the "trough of disillusionment" with the anticipation of GPT-6, Claude 5, and other advanced models. These models are expected to be considered "enterprise-ready" and "true general-purpose models," reigniting discussions about AGI. These advanced models will be deployed in smart-home devices and humanoid robots, with capabilities crossing the uncanny valley. We may see domestic robots becoming more accessible, assisting with chores like cooking and cleaning. Additionally, corporations will likely face a significant talent shortage in AI at all levels.

- GPT-6 and Claude 5: Anticipated next-generation models considered enterprise ready.
- AGI Discussions: Renewed interest in artificial general intelligence.
- Smart-Home Integration: Advanced AI models in smart-home devices and robots.
- Humanoid Robots: Improved real-time abilities, working alongside humans.
- Talent Shortage: Increased demand for AI professionals across all levels. 

## Slide: 2027: The Year of AGI
Experts predict that 2027 may be the year we achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI). Confidence intervals vary, but those with insider knowledge expect the current paradigm to reach AGI around this time. **Corporations and governments will be highly attentive**, leading to a significant market impact and widespread attention. Major disruptions are expected in creative industries, with AI likely producing blockbuster films. Despite AGI's emergence, immediate changes will be tempered by regulations and safety concerns. **Investors will push for rapid AI integration**, prompting CEOs to accelerate AI product development.

- AGI Achievement: Predicted milestone for artificial general intelligence.
- Broad Impact: Significant attention from corporations and governments.
- Creative Disruption: AI's impact on book publishing and Hollywood films.
- Regulatory Constraints: Safety and regulations temper immediate changes.
- Investor Pressure: Rapid AI integration driven by market demands. 

## Slide: 2028: Election Year
In 2028, the world will fully recognize the transformative potential of AGI and robots. While initial capabilities may be moderate, their implications will be profound, **reshaping business, the economy, military, and politics.** The 2028 election will likely center on AI, debating job protection, AI safety, and possibly universal basic income. **Mass layoffs may begin as AGI becomes widespread**, driven by market pressures. This period could be marked by geopolitical tensions, with a potential flashpoint being a conflict between China and the USA, where AI might act as a catalyst.

- Transformative AGI: Recognized impact on all sectors.
- Political Focus: AI as a central topic in the 2028 election.
- Job Market Shift: Mass layoffs as AGI becomes integrated.
- Geopolitical Tension: Potential conflict between China and the USA.
- Societal Transition: Struggles and debates around new paradigms.
