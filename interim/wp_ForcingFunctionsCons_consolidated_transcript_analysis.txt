* **20:22:** "so that system has incentivized people to have lots and lots of small businesses that rarely scale up" - This quote explains the unintended consequence of the Indian regulation, leading to a proliferation of small businesses.
* **21:04:** "when the automation system breaks down that's when everything grinds to a halt" - This quote emphasizes the dramatic impact of system fragility, highlighting the consequences of failure.
* **22:06:** "so these are upper and lower bounds where the system is going to either continue operating at least optimally even or maybe suboptimally but beyond those critical boundaries the system will stop operating" - This quote defines critical boundaries and their significance in system behavior.
