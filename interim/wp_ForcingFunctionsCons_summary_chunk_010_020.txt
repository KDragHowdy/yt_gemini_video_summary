It ensures resource availability, clears the path for new individuals and ideas, and is inevitable due to biological and environmental constraints.<br><br>-  **Evolutionary Benefits**: Removes individuals, reducing resource contention within a species.<br>-  **Natural Exit**: Acts as a conclusion to each individual's evolutionary experiment.<br>-  **Resource Management**: Frees up resources for younger, fitter generations.<br>-  **Social Renewal**: Clears the way for new ideas and societal progress.<br>- **Inevitabile Outcome**: Constraints like disease, accidents, and violence make death unavoidable despite potential advances in lifespan.", "relevance": "This slide examines death as a forcing function from both evolutionary and social standpoints. It highlights its evolutionary benefits in ensuring resource availability and clearing the path for new individuals.

It then explores various types of forcing functions, including those related to system fragility, environmental adaptation, social upheaval, and death.
