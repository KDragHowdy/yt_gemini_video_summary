Affordances are design considerations that provide flexibility and ease of use, promoting desired behaviors by reducing effort. Forcing functions, however, compel specific actions through constraints.\n\n- **Design Tolerances:** Example of the AK-47's design for sand tolerance and loose parts.\n- **Lower Friction:** Making desired behaviors the easiest path.\n- **Environmental Design:** Structuring systems to promote specific behaviors.\n- **Forcing Functions:** Compel actions through strict constraints and boundaries.\n- **Ease of Use:** For instance, easier incorporation laws in the U.S. encourage company formation.\n\n[An image of an AK-47 is displayed on the right side of the slide.]", "relevance": "This slide introduces the key concepts of affordances and forcing functions, which influence behavior through different mechanisms.
