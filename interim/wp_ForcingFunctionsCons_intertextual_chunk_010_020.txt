    "context": "The speaker uses the Kalashnikov AK-47 as an example of design affordances in engineering.",
    "explanation": "The AK-47 is a famous assault rifle known for its reliability and durability, even in harsh conditions. Its design features, such as loose tolerances and fail-safes, contribute to its ability to function under stress. This design philosophy is often referred to as 'robust design' or 'design for reliability'.",
    "relevance": "The speaker uses the AK-47 as an example of how design affordances can facilitate desired behaviors in a system. This relates to the broader discussion of forcing functions, incentives, and constraints in human systems.",
    "connections": "This example connects to the broader theme of how design choices can influence behavior and outcomes in both physical and social systems."
