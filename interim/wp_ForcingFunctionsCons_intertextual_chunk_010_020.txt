    {
      "type": "other",
      "reference": "Affordances",
      "context": "The speaker defines affordances as design features that make certain behaviors easier or more likely.",
      "explanation": "Affordances are properties of objects or environments that suggest how they can be used. They influence how individuals interact with their surroundings and can promote or inhibit specific behaviors.",
      "significance": "This reference introduces another key concept, highlighting how design choices can shape behavior and influence the operation of systems."

    {
      "type": "other",
      "reference": "Instincts",
      "context": "The speaker discusses instincts as innate patterns of behavior.",
      "explanation": "Instincts are innate, reliable patterns of behavior that are biologically ingrained. They are often triggered by specific stimuli and can be considered automatic responses.",
      "significance": "This reference provides another perspective on the factors influencing behavior, highlighting the role of innate biological predispositions."
