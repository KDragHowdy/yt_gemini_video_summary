  {
    "reference": "Jailbreaking",
    "context": "you can Jailbreak models",
    "explanation": "In the context of AI, 'jailbreaking' refers to techniques used to bypass safety measures or limitations imposed on a language model, potentially leading to unexpected or undesirable outputs.",
    "relevance": "The speaker uses jailbreaking as an example of potential AI vulnerabilities, but argues that it's not necessarily evidence of fundamental incorrigibility.",
    "connections": "Connects to the discussion of AI vulnerabilities and the debate about whether these vulnerabilities constitute a fundamental risk."
  },
  {
    "reference": "Adversarial Attacks",
    "context": "there's also adversarial attacks",
    "explanation": "Adversarial attacks are techniques used to intentionally mislead or manipulate AI systems by subtly altering inputs, causing them to produce incorrect or unexpected outputs.",
    "relevance": "The speaker acknowledges adversarial attacks as another potential AI vulnerability, but again argues that they don't necessarily imply fundamental incorrigibility.",
    "connections": "Connects to the discussion of AI vulnerabilities and the broader theme of AI safety."
