  - **Title:** 2024: AI Expectations
  - **Text:** In 2024, we anticipate significant advancements in AI technology. GPT-5 is rumored to be released, with Claude 4 also on the horizon, likely intensifying the release cycle competition. Multimodal models, particularly those generating high-quality video and audio, are expected to make a substantial impact. There will likely be progress in creating smaller, faster, and more cost-effective models that maintain high performance. Additionally, the first commercial humanoid robots might begin to appear, though they will likely be limited in their initial capabilities.
  - **Bullet Points:**
    - GPT-5: Expected to release in late 2024 or early 2025.
    - Claude 4: Anticipated around the same time, increasing competition.
    - Multimodal Models: Improved video and audio generators emerging.
    - Condensed Models: Smaller, faster, and cheaper models maintaining high performance.
    - Humanoid Robots: First commercial versions potentially rolling out by year-end.

- **Timestamp:** 4:38
- **Content:**
  - **Title:** 2025: Benchmark Mastery
  - **Text:** In 2025, the focus will likely shift to utilizing and integrating GPT-5 and Claude-4 models. These models are expected to bring incremental changes, achieving better performance but not revolutionary improvements, achieving around 95% on benchmarks, these models will still significantly impact many fields. Enterprises and SMBs will begin widespread deployment of these AI technologies, leading to increased hiring for AI-enabled roles. However, full integration may face initial infrastructure challenges and require new solutions.
  - **Bullet Points:**
    - GPT-5 and Claude-4: Incremental improvements over current models.
    - Benchmark Performance: Models achieving around 95% on reasoning tasks.
    - Enterprise Deployment: Widespread adoption by businesses and SMBs.
    - AI Hiring Surge: Increased demand for AI-enabled teams and roles.
    - Integration Challenges: Initial infrastructure limitations and new integration needs.
