There will likely be progress in creating smaller, faster, and more cost-effective models that maintain high performance. Additionally, the first commercial humanoid robots might begin to appear, though they will likely be limited in their initial capabilities.\n-- GPT-5: Expected to release in late 2024 or early 2025.\n-- Claude 4: Anticipated around the same time, increasing competition.\n-- Multimodal Models: Improved video and audio generators emerging.\n-- Condensed Models: Smaller, faster, and cheaper models maintaining high performance.\n-- Humanoid Robots: First commercial versions potentially rolling out by year-end."}, {"type": "slide", "time": 4:38, "content": "2025: Benchmark Mastery\nIn 2025, the focus will likely shift to utilizing and integrating GPT-5 and Claude-4 models. These models are expected to bring incremental changes, achieving better performance but not revolutionary improvements, achieving around 95% on benchmarks. These models will still significantly impact many fields. Enterprises and SMBs will begin widespread deployment of these Al technologies, leading to increased hiring for Al-enabled roles. However, full integration may face initial infrastructure challenges and require new solutions.\n-- GPT-5 and Claude-4: Incremental improvements over current models.\n-- Benchmark Performance: Models achieving around 95% on reasoning tasks.\n-- Enterprise Deployment: Widespread adoption by businesses and SMBs.\n-- AI Hiring Surge: Increased demand for Al-enabled teams and roles.\n-- Integration Challenges: Initial infrastructure limitations and new integration needs."}, {"type": "slide", "time": 4:38, "content": "HI\nwanted"}]}
