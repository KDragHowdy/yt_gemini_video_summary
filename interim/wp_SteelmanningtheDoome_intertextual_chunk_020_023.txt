    "explanation": "The Red Queen Hypothesis, originating in evolutionary biology, suggests that organisms must constantly adapt and evolve to survive, even when their environment remains relatively stable. It's named after the Red Queen in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass, who says 'it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place'.",
