AGI-enabled material science and genetic technology will yield significant breakthroughs, leading to a resurgence of optimism akin to the post-war boom of the 1950s. The Fourth Industrial Revolution will drive significant breakthroughs. The Fourth Industrial Revolution will drive frequent announcements of disease cures, lifespan extensions, and cybernetic implants. This progress will be achieved despite initial infrastructure and deployment challenges. Domestic and commercial robots will become commonplace, though the most advanced models will remain costly.\n\n- AI and Quantum Leap: Rapid adoption and integration of AI and quantum computing.\n-
