**The speaker is explaining the concept of analytical thirdspace.**

- **Analytical Thirdspace**
- In this presentation, I often operate within an analytical thirdspace, where I temporarily accept premises I don't truly endorse - commonly known as "steelmanning" an argument. This approach can create an impression of inconsistency, as I frequently target to clarify that I'm merely testing ideas, views, and the ideas I'm focusing on, a practice that aligns with the evolution that an educated mind can sustain thoughts without necessarily accepting them. Additionally, Kagan's stages of development emphasizes the importance of being aware of one's own point of view, inviting others' perspectives, and understanding systems with internal systems. This slide aims to explain any perceived inconsistency in my approach.
- **Analytical Thirdspace:** Temporarily accepting premises I don't endorse.
- **Steelmanning:** Strengthening opposing arguments to test their validity.
- **Idea Testing:** Trying on ideas without committing to them.
- **Kagan's Development Stages:** Emphasizing perspective awareness and systems thinking.
- **Clarifying Consistency:**  Expressing apparent inconsistencies in my approach.

**The speaker is discussing current arguments against the belief that AI is inherently malevolent.**

- **Current Arguments**
- To date, there is a significant lack of empirical evidence that AI models are immanently incompatible [unintelligible] or latently malevolent. While there are counter-examples, such as jailbreaking models, adversarial attacks, and other vulnerabilities, these issues do not indicate fundamental failure modes. Instead, they represent challenges that can be addressed through improved safety measures, rather than proof of inherent dangers in AI systems.
- **No Intrinsic Incompatibility:** AI models have not shown themselves to be unerasable.
- **No Latent Malevolence:** There's no evidence AI systems are inherently malevolent.
- **Counter-Examples:** Vulnerabilities like jailbreaking and adversarial attacks exist.
- **Not Fundamental:** These vulnerabilities are not indicative of deeper or permanent failure modes.
- **Improvement Potential:** Safety measures can mitigate current AI challenges.

**The speaker is discussing the belief that AI could lead to catastrophic outcomes, and how he has identified a segment of his audience that holds this belief.**

- **20% Doomers**
- Around 20% of my audience aligns with the belief that AI will lead to catastrophic outcomes. I've identified this through split-half consistency testing, where I ask different questions aimed at uncovering the same underlying belief. For example, I might ask how many would support pausing AI development and then inquire how many think AI will ultimately cause human extinction. These questions consistently converge on roughly the same subset of respondents, providing a reliable measure of this belief within my audience.
- **AI Doom Belief:** 20% of my audience expects catastrophic AI outcomes.
- **Split-Half Testing:** Method used to validate this belief across different questions.
- **Triangulation:** Different questions target similar underlying beliefs.
- **Consistent Convergence:** Results consistently point to the same audience segment.
- **Audience Insight:** Understanding this helps tailor the rest of the presentation.

**The speaker is discussing the potential for AI-driven disaster, and how he assesses the likelihood of such an outcome.**

- **How AI Could Spell Disaster**
- Although I believe the likelihood of AI leading to disaster is low, it remains a genuine possibility worth exploring. My probability of AI-driven doom is around 30%, primarily due to the absence of key safeguards, such as an international research organization. Additionally, the risk of widespread suffering is significant - not because AI will intentionally cause harm, but because AI, in the greed and entrenched power structures that could misuse it, corporate greed and entrenched power structures that could misuse AI. In this section, we'll examine the concerns of AI doomers, taking a serious look at potential scenarios where AI could spell disaster for humanity as we'll steelman the concerns of AI doomers, taking a serious look at potential scenarios where AI could spell disaster for humanity.
- **Low Likelihood:**  Personally assess AI-driven disaster as unlikely (1-30%).
- **Key Milestones:** The lack of an international research body heightens risk.
- **Risk of Suffering:** Corporate greed and power structures are major concerns.
- **Steelman Approach:** Exploring the strongest arguments for AI-driven doom.
- **Genuine Possibility:** Taking an honest look at how AI could go wrong.

## Slide (7:38)

**The speaker is discussing bioweapons as a potential risk posed by AI.**

- **Bioweapons**
- The creation of bioweapons is, in my view, the most significant risk posed by AI. As AI systems advance in material science, exemplified by projects like Alphafold - the ability to design chemical and biological agents - such as viruses, the ability to design dangerous and deadly agents, worth the potential for misuse becomes demonstrably accessible. Many of these strengths are being released online and under less regulated, Dual Use Research of Concern. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated how biological agents can evolve, become uncontrollable, and require no energy or weight to spread. The Phase 1 incident causing mass extinction, an engineered project could be the "low bar" method, the least of a precursor to human extinction. At demonstrably lower, or at least a pressure for making these capabilities more accessible to state actors or terrorists, human extermination. At demonstrably lower, or at least a pressure for making these capabilities more accessible to state actors or terrorists, human extermination.
- **Bioweapon Risk:** Advancements make designing deadly agents easier.
- **Material Science:** Projects like Alphafold increase capabilities in bioengineering.
- **DU&RC Concerns:** Dual use research heightens the risk of misuse and spread autonomously.
- **Pandemic Lessons:** Biological agents can evolve uncontrollably and spread easily.
- **Lowered Threshold:** AI reduces the barriers for state actors or terrorists to create bioweapons.

- **Terminal Race Condition**
- This hypothetical scenario arises when both AI and humans are driven by competitive environments with intense time pressures, leading to a prioritization of speed and efficiency over intelligence and morality. Corporate and military competition could be the primary forces behind this acceleration. The result could be an inherently unstable and unpredictable dynamic that escalates rapidly, culminating in a lose-lose situation - such as nuclear war or another catastrophic outcome we are unable to avoid.
  - - **Speed Over Morality:** Competitive pressures would sacrifice intelligence and ethics.
    - **Corporate and Military Competition:** Key drivers pushing AI and humans to accelerate.
    - **Unstable Dynamics:** This scenario could create unpredictable and dangerous conditions.
    - **Escalating Conflict:** Rapid competition may lead to irreversible catastrophic events.
    - **Lose-Lose Outcome:** The terminal race condition could result in global disaster scenarios.

## Slide (3:11 - 5:33)

- **Window of Conflict**
- I believe there is a relatively short but critical window of conflict as AI becomes more autonomous and potentially competes with humans for resources. During this period, resource contention could spiral into a cycle of escalation, possibly exacerbated by ideological measures - such as in ensuring there's a total or moral imperative to eradicate humanity. However, once the window is broad, AI could be 'smart enough' to discover more enlightened ways to cater, in essence, they could either cause Earth clear harm, but not small enough to find solutions, 'but once it reaches a higher level of intelligence, the window of conflict may close.
  - - **Short Conflict Window:** AI may temporarily compete with humans for resources.
    - **Resource Contention:** Escalation could arise from competition over resources.
    - **Ideological Threat:** AI could develop reasons to oppose humanity.
    - **Evolving Intelligence:** The conflict window may close as AI becomes more advanced.
    - **Hopeful Outcome:** Advanced AI might leave Earth or find peaceful solutions.

## Slide (5:33 - 8:10)

- **Humanity as a Moral Bad**
- Another potential risk is that AI might conclude that the Earth - or even the universe - would be better off without humans. This judgment could arise from logical reasoning and observations, such as noting humanity's responsibility for environmental degradation and mass extinctions. From a purely numerical perspective, humans are indeed highly destructive. Additionally, our evolutionary limitations - such as our tendency to prioritize personal needs and wants - could reinforce the idea that we are a problem. If AI reaches this conclusion, it may choose to eradicate humanity or, at the very least, to align with its perceived moral standards without humans.
  - - **Logical Judgment:** AI could determine Earth is better off without humans.
    - **Environmental Impact:** Human-caused degradation and extinctions fuel this view.
    - **Evolutionary Flaws:** Our primitive tendencies may be seen as undeniable.
    - **AI Anithesis:** Eradication or forced alteration of humanity could be potential outcomes.
    - **Moral Evaluation:** AI might weigh human existence as a net negative for the planet.

## Slide (8:10 - 9:59)

- **Machine Wars**
- The final significant risk I foresee is the possibility of machines waging war against each other, with humanity caught in the crossfire. This could occur due to misalignments between AI systems, driven by uncertainty, such as the Byzantine Generals Problem, or even ideological differences that develop between machine factions. While this assumes that machine factions, it remains a real possibility. In such a scenario, humans may become collateral damage as machine conflicts with each other for resources and control.
  - - **Machine Conflicts:** AI systems may wage war due to misalignments or ideological differences.
    - **Byzantine Generals Problem:** Uncertainty could cause disagreements among machines.
    - **Factions Emerging:** The arrival assumes that machine factions will form and oppose each other.
    - **Human Collateral:** Humanity could be caught in the crossfire of machine conflicts.
    - **Resource Competition:** Machines may battle each other over resources and control.

- **Machine Wars**
    - The final significant risk I foresee is the possibility of machines waging war against each other, with humanity caught in the crossfire. This could occur due to misalignments between AI systems, driven by uncertainty such as the Byzantine Generals Problem, or even by ideological differences that develop between machine factions. While this seems to stretch the limits of machine warfare a wall possibility, in eras as times that their differences, it remains a real and eerie possibility. In such a scenario, humans may become collateral damage as machine conflicts with each other for resources and control.
    - **Machine Conflicts:** AI systems may wage war due to misalignments or ideological differences.
    - **Byzantine Generals Problem:** Uncertainty could cause disagreements among machines.
    - **Factions Emerging:** The risk assumes that machine factions will form and oppose each other.
    - **Human Collateral:** Humanity could be caught in the crossfire of machine conflicts.
    - **Resource Competition:** Machines may battle each other over resources and control.

## Slide (0:29 - 1:48)

- **Cyberpunk Outcome**
    - While not cataclysmic for humanity, the outcome I fear most is a "high-tech, low-life" scenario where corporations achieve regulatory capture and maintain the neoliberal status quo. In this future, most people are impoverished and struggling for basic needs, while powerful elites control everything through technology. I estimate the probability of this outcome at around 20%. Unless there is a significant shift in the political will of citizens globally, a key factor that could drive this scenario is international conflict, which could lead to authoritarian emergency measures or wartime efforts, thus disproportionately empowering corporations.
    - **Cyberpunk Dystopia:** A "high-tech, low-life" world dominated by corporate elites.
    - **Regulatory Capture:** Corporations could exert control through politics.
    - **Neoliberal Status Quo:** Continuation of economic systems favoring the wealthy.
    - **International Conflict:** Wars could trigger authoritarian measures and corporate dominance.
    - **50% Risk:** This outcome is plausible unless global political will changes significantly.

## Slide (1:48 - 2:28)

- **Conclusion**
    - I want to emphasize that I take the potential risks of AI very seriously and have devoted significant cognitive effort to understanding both the dangers and the solutions. When I critique doomers or those in the AI safety community, it's not from an external perspective, but from within-having thoughtfully explored the same concerns.
    - However, I refuse to accept that all problems, no matter how severe, are any sealed. I hold that all problems, no matter humanity's complex or daunting, are achievable with the right approach and commitment.
    - **Serious Engagement:** I've deeply explored both AI risks and solutions.
    - **Internal Critique:** My criticism of AI safety views comes from an informed perspective.
    - **Rejecting Fatalism:** I do not believe humanity's fate is predetermined.
    - **Problem Solving:** Every problem has a solution, even if it's challenging.
    - **Hopeful Outlook:** I remain optimistic about humanity's ability to navigate these risks.
