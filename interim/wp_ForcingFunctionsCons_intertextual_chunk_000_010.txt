      "context": "The video uses the terms \"constraints\" and \"affordances\" in relation to forcing functions.",
      "explanation": "Constraints limit user behavior, while affordances suggest possible actions within a system.",
      "significance": "These concepts from design thinking highlight how forcing functions shape user interaction and behavior within a given system."

      "explanation": "The size of a workspace is a common topic in pop culture, particularly in discussions of organization, minimalism, and productivity.",
      "significance": "This relatable example allows viewers to connect the concept of forcing functions to their own experiences with space management."

      "explanation": "Laundry baskets often serve as a practical limit for the amount of laundry that can be done at once.",
      "significance": "This everyday example further illustrates the idea of forcing functions as practical constraints that influence behavior."

      "explanation": "The capacity of a dishwasher is a common constraint for people who do dishes, influencing the frequency of washing.",

      "explanation": "This method relies on a physical limitation (pant size) to motivate a desired change (weight loss).",
      "significance": "The video uses this unconventional example to highlight the versatility of forcing functions, showing how they can be implemented in personal contexts beyond traditional design elements."
