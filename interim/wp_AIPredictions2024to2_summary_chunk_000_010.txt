## A Look Ahead: AI Predictions for 2024-2030

This video takes us on a journey through the anticipated future of AI, exploring key milestones and potential challenges in the years to come. The speaker, a self-proclaimed AI enthusiast, guides us through their predictions, acknowledging both the excitement and potential "trough of disillusionment" that lie ahead. 

### A Chronological Journey Through the Video

**Slide 1 (0:00):** The video begins with a striking image of a swirling, colorful "DS" logo, setting the stage for a discussion about the "Next Few Years of AI." The title "Exciting and Turbulent Times Ahead" hints at the complex and dynamic nature of the field.

**Slide 2 (1:04):** The first concrete predictions are presented on this slide, focusing on 2024. The image of a humanoid robot, with its abstract design, reflects the potential for significant advancements in robotics. The slide outlines key expectations:

* **GPT-5 and Claude-4:** The release of these advanced language models is anticipated, likely intensifying competition in the AI space.
* **Multimodal Models:** The emergence of models capable of generating high-quality video and audio is expected to have a significant impact.
* **Condensed Models:** Smaller, faster, and more cost-effective models are predicted to maintain high performance, making AI more accessible.
* **Humanoid Robots:** The first commercial versions of humanoid robots are expected to appear, though their initial capabilities will be limited.

**Slide 3 (4:38):** This slide shifts the focus to 2025, a year marked as the "year of disillusionment." The image of a "Help Wanted" sign, with a large "H" and a "wanted" sign, reflects the anticipated surge in demand for AI-enabled roles. The slide outlines the following:

* **Benchmark Mastery:** GPT-5 and Claude-4 are expected to achieve high performance on various benchmarks, reaching around 95% accuracy. However, the speaker acknowledges that this might not be enough to achieve true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
* **Enterprise Deployment:** Widespread adoption of AI technologies by businesses and small and medium enterprises (SMBs) is anticipated.
* **AI Hiring Surge:** Increased demand for AI-enabled teams and roles is expected.
* **Integration Challenges:** Initial infrastructure limitations and new integration needs are likely to pose challenges.

### Key Points and Information

The speaker acknowledges the slowing down of breakthroughs in AI, despite the rapid release of new models. They attribute this to the increasing cost of achieving breakthroughs and the diminishing returns of current AI models. This leads them to predict a period of "disillusionment" in 2025, where progress might not meet expectations.

Despite this, the speaker remains optimistic about the future of AI, particularly in the field of robotics. They believe that robotics will be the next big step in AI advancements, citing examples from companies in China, America, and even Disney.

### Notable Quotes

* "We're entering into the trough of disillusionment."
* "The breakthroughs that we that we're hoping to see are going to be happening slower even if the Cadence of model releases is a little bit faster."
* "I think that 2024 we're not going to have a whole lot more exciting news. I think robotics is going to be the next most exciting thing."
* "2025 I think is going to be the year of the disillusionment where a lot of people myself included are going to be kind of disappointed."

### Intertextual References

The speaker's use of the term "trough of disillusionment" is a direct reference to the Gartner Hype Cycle, a model that describes the maturity and adoption of technologies over time. This reference highlights the speaker's realistic view of AI development, acknowledging that progress might not always be linear and that periods of disappointment are expected.

The mention of GPT-5 and Claude-4, along with the discussion of AGI, demonstrates the speaker's focus on the evolution of large language models and their potential impact on various fields. The speaker's reference to "Hollywood-quality visuals" highlights their realistic expectations about the limitations of current AI technology in achieving specific artistic goals.

### Overall Flow and Structure

The video segment follows a clear chronological structure, starting with a general overview of the "Next Few Years of AI" and then focusing on specific predictions for 2024 and 2025. The visual elements, primarily slides with text and bullet points, effectively support the spoken content, providing a clear and concise presentation of the key points. The images, while abstract, add visual interest and help to illustrate the speaker's ideas.

### Narrator Style Summary

The video paints a cautiously optimistic picture of the future of AI. While acknowledging the potential for disappointment in 2025, the speaker emphasizes the importance of realistic expectations and the exciting potential of robotics as the next frontier in AI development.  The speaker highlights the ongoing competition in the AI space, with the release of GPT-5 and Claude-4 anticipated to further fuel this rivalry.  Despite the challenges ahead, the speaker believes that AI will continue to make significant progress, transforming various industries and aspects of our lives.
