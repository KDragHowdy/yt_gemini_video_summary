GPT-5 is rumored to be released, with Claude 4 also on the horizon, likely intensifying the release cycle competition. Multimodal models, particularly those generating high-quality video and audio, are expected to make a substantial impact. There will likely be progress in creating smaller, faster, and more cost-effective models that maintain high performance. Additionally, the first commercial humanoid robots might begin to appear, though they will likely be limited in their initial capabilities.  - GPT-5: Expected to release in late 2024 or early 2025. - Claude 4: Anticipated around the same time, increasing competition. - Multimodal Models: Improved video and audio generators emerging.  - Condensed Models: Smaller, faster, and cheaper models maintaining high performance. - Humanoid Robots: First commercial versions potentially rolling out by year-end."}, {"type": "slide", "timestamp": "4:37", "content": "2025: Benchmark Mastery In 2025, the focus will likely shift to utilizing and integrating GPT-5 and Claude-4 models.
