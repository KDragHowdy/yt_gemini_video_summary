    "reference": "Affordances and forcing functions",
    "context": "The speaker uses these terms to describe how systems can be designed to encourage or discourage certain behaviors. This is a key concept in the video.",
    "explanation": "Affordances and forcing functions are design principles used in user interface design and human-computer interaction. Affordances refer to the perceived properties of an object that suggest how it can be used. Forcing functions are constraints that prevent users from making errors or ensure that they complete a certain action. These concepts are often applied to design systems that are more intuitive and user-friendly.",
    "relevance": "The speaker uses these concepts to explain how systems can be designed to encourage or discourage certain behaviors. This is a key concept in the video.",
    "connections": "These concepts are connected to the broader theme of system design and how it can influence behavior."

    "reference": "System fragility",
    "context": "The speaker uses this term to describe how systems can be vulnerable to failure. This is another key concept in the video.",
    "explanation": "System fragility refers to the susceptibility of a system to breakdown or failure. This is a common concern in engineering and technology, as complex systems are often prone to errors and malfunctions. System fragility can lead to significant disruptions and costs.",
    "relevance": "The speaker uses this concept to explain how systems can be vulnerable to failure. This is another key concept in the video.",
    "connections": "This concept is connected to the broader theme of system design and how it can influence behavior. It is also related to the concept of operational tolerances, as systems that are more fragile may have narrower operational tolerances."

    "reference": "Operational tolerances",
    "context": "The speaker uses this term to describe the range of conditions under which a system can operate effectively. This is a key concept in the video.",
    "explanation": "Operational tolerances refer to the range of conditions under which a system can operate effectively. This is a crucial concept in engineering and design, as it helps to ensure that systems can function reliably under different conditions. Operational tolerances are often defined by upper and lower bounds, which represent the limits of acceptable performance.",
    "relevance": "The speaker uses this concept to explain how systems can be designed to operate effectively within certain limits. This is a key concept in the video.",
    "connections": "This concept is connected to the broader theme of system design and how it can influence behavior. It is also related to the concept of system fragility, as systems with narrower operational tolerances may be more prone to failure."

    "reference": "Critical boundaries",
    "context": "The speaker uses this term to describe the limits of a system's operational tolerances. This is a key concept in the video.",
    "explanation": "Critical boundaries refer to the limits of a system's operational tolerances. These boundaries define the upper and lower limits of acceptable performance, beyond which the system may experience significant disruptions or failures. Critical boundaries are important for understanding the resilience and robustness of a system.",
    "relevance": "The speaker uses this concept to explain how systems can be designed to operate effectively within certain limits. This is a key concept in the video.",

    "context": "The speaker uses this term to describe a situation where a system completely fails to operate. This is a key concept in the video.",
    "explanation": "System collapse refers to a complete failure of a system to operate. This can occur when a system exceeds its critical boundaries or experiences a catastrophic event. System collapse can have significant consequences, including disruptions to services, loss of data, and financial losses.",
    "relevance": "The speaker uses this concept to illustrate the potential consequences of exceeding a system's operational tolerances. This is a key concept in the video.",
    "connections": "This concept is connected to the broader theme of system design and how it can influence behavior. It is also related to the concepts of system fragility and critical boundaries, as these factors can contribute to system collapse."
